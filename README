Problems encountered:
I encountered many problems in this lab.
  1. The first problem I met was how to find command line arguments. I misunderstood the
     method that are demonstrated in hello_asm.asm. I treated the argv as several values
     on stack rather than a pointer to an array. Finally, I solved this problem.
  2. The second problem I met was that I forgot the “call” instruction will push eip to
     the top of the stack, and I wrongly used the position of that eip value as the
     the position of the first argument.
  3. I used ebx and ecx as loop counters, but I forgot to save it on stack before function
     call.
